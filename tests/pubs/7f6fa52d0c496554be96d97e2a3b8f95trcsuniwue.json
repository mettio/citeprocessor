    "abstract": "Knowledge Based Systems KBS have been successfully developed in various domains based on techniques and tools from Knowledge Engineering KE. The classic KE approach to system modeling uses mostly symbolic logic-based symbolic knowledge representation methods, which are more specific from Artificial Intelligence AI in a broad sense, that has recently included computational intelligence techniques. Since most of the implementations of today KBS are software based, Software Engineering SE methods and tools play an important role in their development. Moreover, recent developments in SE emphasize the importance of the use of formalized symbolic representations in the software development process.",
